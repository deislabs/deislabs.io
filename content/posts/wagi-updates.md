A few months ago, [our team introduced WAGI][wagi-announcement], or the
WebAssembly Gateway Interface, a simple way of writing and executing HTTP
response handlers as WebAssembly modules. Since we open sourced the project, the
community has been adding critical features that make WAGI one of the easiest
ways to build WebAssembly microservices, and in this article we explore some of
the new features.

#### A primer on WAGI

WAGI is for writing HTTP handlers. It uses [WASI, the WebAssembly System
Interface][wasi], and exposes HTTP request information to a WebAssembly module
as environment variables and through standard input and output. This means that
for any language that compiles to WASI, writing an HTTP handler that runs on
WAGI is as easy as reading from `stdin` and writing to `stdout`.

Echoing the body of a request can be done by copying the standard input stream
directly to standard output (or it can be read as a byte array and further
processed), and in Rust it can be done in the following way:

```rust
use std::io::{copy, stdin, stdout};

fn main() {
    println!("Content-Type: text/plain\n");

    println!("Server received body:");
    copy(&mut stdin(), &mut stdout()).unwrap();
}
```

After compiling the module to `wasm32-wasi`, create a new WAGI configuration
file that sets the `/echo` route to execute the compiled WebAssembly module as
an HTTP handler:

```toml
[[module]]
route = "/echo"
module = "target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello-wagi.wasm"
```

Then start WAGI by running `wagi --config wagi.toml`. At this point, WAGI can
receive requests which will be delegated to the built module:

```
$ curl localhost:3000/echo -X POST -d 'Testing WAGI'
Server received body:
Testing WAGI
```

Any language that compiles to WASI can be used to write WAGI handlers, together
with any external library for these languages that is compilable to
`wasm32-wasi`. So far, our team has been testing with Rust, C/C++,
AssemblyScript, Swift, Grain, and Zig, but more and more compiler toolchains are
adding support for emitting WebAssembly.

#### Outbound HTTP connections

Networking in WASI is one scenario that doesn't have a stable API yet. This
restricts the types of workloads that can be executed in WASI runtimes for now,
which is why we released an [experimental outbound HTTP library for
WASI][http-library] that allows modules to create outbound HTTP connections.

Specifically, the published [NPM package][npm] and [crate][crate] can be used to
send HTTP requests from AssemblyScript and Rust guest modules running in WAGI -
for example, making a `GET` request and reading the response body as a string in
AssemblyScript:

```typescript
import { Console } from "as-wasi";
import { Method, RequestBuilder } from "@deislabs/wasi-experimental-http";

export function _start(): void {
  Console.write("Content-Type: text/plain\n");

  let res = new RequestBuilder("https://api.brigade.sh/healthz")
    .method(Method.GET)
    .send();
  let str = String.UTF8.decode(res.bodyReadAll().buffer);
  Console.write("Result from request: " + str);
}
```

Notice how the module will attempt to make an HTTP request to
`https://api.brigade.sh/healthz` - before starting WAGI with this module, we
have to explicitly allow the guest module to make a request to this host using
the `allowed_hosts` field in the WAGI configuration for this module:

```toml
[[module]]
route = "/as-http"
module = "as/build/optimized.wasm"
allowed_hosts = ["https://api.brigade.sh"]
```

Keep in mind that this library is experimental, and breaking changes could occur
in the future.

#### Pulling modules from OCI registries

Given the widespread adoption of the container ecosystem, a natural choice for
distributing WebAssembly modules intended to run outside the browser is OCI
registries, and WAGI now supports referencing and pulling modules from
supporting OCI registries (for a list of registries that have support for
distributing Wasm modules, check the [`wasm-to-oci` repository][wto]).

We can take any compiled WebAssembly module and push it to one of the compatible
registries using [`wasm-to-oci`][wto], a tool that leverages the [ORAS][oras]
and [OCI artifacts][artifacts] projects - for example, pushing the module we
just built to the [GitHub Package Registry][gh]:

```
$ wasm-to-oci push as/build/optimized.wasm ghcr.io/radu-matei/as-http:v1
INFO[0003] Pushed: ghcr.io/radu-matei/as-http:v1
INFO[0003] Size: 9004
INFO[0003] Digest: sha256:994c8adcef53e93f1b817d6d16367ed3897376378cad88eb31cfdfabbcb6b253
```

We can now modify the WAGI configuration to point to the newly pushed
repository:

```toml
[[module]]
route = "/as-http"
module = "oci://ghcr.io/radu-matei/as-http:v1"
allowed_hosts = ["https://api.brigade.sh"]
```

After the first pull from the registry, WAGI will cache the module so the
instantiation overhead is minimal.

Currently, the repositories have to enable anonymous pulls for WAGI to work, but
we are [tracking the request to add authentication for
registries][private-registry]. As a workaround, `wasm-to-oci pull` can be used
before starting WAGI to pull modules from authenticated repositories.

Besides using the local filesystem and OCI registries as sources for modules,
WAGI can also pull artifacts from [Bindle][bindle], although [support for it is
still early][bindle-wagi].

#### Declaring sub-routes in the module

WAGI now also allows modules to define their own sub-routes - specifically, in
cases when we want a single module to handle more than one sub-route, by
implementing and exporting a `_routes()` function in the module that maps routes
to custom handler functions:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Content-Type: text/plain\n\n Hello from main()");
}

// Use no_mangle so we can call this from WAGI or other external tools.
#[no_mangle]
/// A provider function that can be called directly
pub fn hello() {
    println!("Content-Type: text/plain\n\n Hello")
}

#[no_mangle]
/// Another provider function that can be called directly.
pub fn goodbye() {
    println!("Content-Type: text/plain\n\n Goodbye")
}

// This maps a few routes:
// '/hello' will result in the `hello()` function being called.
// '/goodbye' and all subpaths of '/goodbye' will call the `goodbye()` function.
//
// Note that when compiled, the `main` function is named `_start()`. So if you want
// to map to that function, it is `/main _start`.
#[no_mangle]
pub fn _routes() {
    println!("/hello hello");
    println!("/goodbye/... goodbye");
    println!("/main _start");
}
```

Then, defining the top-level route for the module as `/example` in the WAGI
configuration file:

```toml
[[module]]
route = "/example"
module = "/PATH/TO/hello_wagi.wasm"
```

After WAGI starts and build the routes, this module will map `/example` to
`_start()`, `/example/hello` to `hello()`, and `/example/goodbye/...` to
`goodbye()` (including wildcards).

You can find a [full routing example here][routes-example].

#### Using Azure services from Rust modules

Built on top of the outbound HTTP support, we have been experimenting with using
various Azure services from WASI modules running in WAGI, using the [Azure SDK
for Rust][sdk] - specifically, using [Azure Blob Storage][bs] (reading and
writing blobs), [Cosmos DB][cosmos] (reading and writing documents and
collections), and [EventGrid][ev] (sending messages and handling event
subscriptions through HTTP webhooks).

We are excited by the prospect of having fully portable modules running in a
Wasm sandbox that use Azure services, packaged at less than 3 MB (with room for
further optimization). An initial set of samples for WAGI modules using Azure
services [can be found on GitHub][azure-samples], and we would love to hear your
feedback about building and running them.

#### Optimizing compiled modules and caching

We highly recommend using optimization tools to shrink the size of the resulting
binary or speed-up the instantiation time. The following represents a
non-exhaustive list of tools and techniques our team has been experimenting
with:

- [`wasm-opt` from Binaryen][binaryen] - by removing debug symbols and unused
  module elements, together with an entire suite of instruction optimizers,
  `wasm-opt` is perhaps the most widespread tool, and depending on the toolchain
  used to compile modules, it can have exceptional results in shrinking the
  module size.
- [`wizer` from the Bytecode Alliance][wizer] is a tool that pre-initializes
  WebAssembly modules - it _executes their initialization function, and then
  snapshots the initialized state out into a new WebAssembly module._ If a
  module spends significant time initializing, it might be a good candidate for
  Wizer, and for specific types of workloads, it can yield startup times of up
  to 6x faster.
- [Wasmtime caching][cache] in WAGI - by default, Wasmtime, the runtime used by
  WAGI, will compile a WebAssembly module just-in-time (JIT) for the current
  architecture it is running on. Wasmtime caching writes the compiled module to
  a temporary cache and when instantiating a module, it checks whether an
  already compiled version of it already exists in the cache, resulting in
  significant startup speed improvements for large modules. WAGI provides a
  `--cache` flag pointing to a Wasmtime cache file, but keep in mind that for
  small modules, the overhead introduced by the filesystem access might increase
  the instantiation time.
- ahead-of-time compilation (AOT) with [`wasmtime compile`][wasmtime-aot] - as
  opposed to JIT compilation, with AOT compilation, Wasmtime creates a new
  module that is already compiled for the current architecture (or
  cross-compile). This means that before instantiating, Wasmtime will not have
  to perform a JIT compilation, nor access the filesystem cache to check if an
  already compiled version exists. This requires an extra step after pulling the
  module, but for large modules, the performance improvements are significant.

These are just a few potential optimization techniques that can be performed
with WAGI, and real world usage indicates that, depending on the workload,
language, and runtime, a combination of these could improve the binary size or
startup time for a given module. If there are other optimization techniques we
can enable for WAGI, let us know about them in [WAGI's issue queue][github].

#### We would love to hear your feedback

WAGI is still in its early stages, but we are excited about the ways it could be
used. We welcome all contributions that adhere to our [code of conduct][coc],
and we are looking forward to your pull requests, issues, and suggestion.
